## Summary
Dead Rising 2 is about a motocross champion named Chuck Greene who travels to Fortune City, Nevada with his young daughter, Katey, in
order to participate in a controversial TV show called Terror is Reality, which sees contestants brutally slaughter their way through 
hordes of zombies in order to get cash prizes. After taking part in the show, the zombies that are kept on the set of the show somehow
break free from their confinements and begin attacking the spectators, creating a zombie outbreak that spreads all throughout Fortune
City. Chuck, Katey, and a few survivors are able to find shelter in the Fortune City Safe House where Chuck learns, via a news report
that he has been accused/framed of starting the outbreak. Now Chuck must travel Fortune City, investigation the cause of the outbreak,
keep Katey alive, save Survivors, and survive against the zombie horde, all while waiting for rescue to arrive from the outside.

The main mechanic of this game is the combat system. While journeying through the mall, Chuck has the ability to find weapons,
both conventional and unconventional, that he can use against the zombies ranging from melee weapons to ranged weapons such as guns and
crossbows. Hordes of zombies litter the city and Chuck must be able to fight his way through them all. Around Fortune City, Chuck
can find recipe cards that teach him how to combine certain items together in order to create powerful Combo Weapons that can be
used to make devastating and high powered attacks against the zombies. Killing zombies allows Chuck to gain EXP which can cause him
to level up and make him stronger.

The game features a completely open world where Chuck can explore with ease. He can find food and drink items lying around that he
can use to heal himself up. He can find magazines that, when read, allow Chuck to learn new fighting techniques against the zombies
or provide some kind of status buff. He can fully interact with the world around him and do non-essential things such as playing
the slot machines, riding the mechanical bull, climb up onto objects, and pretty much anything he wants. The game also features an
in-game time system and day and night system during which certain events and plot-related happenings occur at specific in-game times.

All throughout Fortune City, there are Survivors who managed to survive the initial zombie onslaught and are doing their best to
survive, but won't last long. As an optional side quest, Chuck can encounter survivors that his friend Stacey spots on the security
cameras (known as Marked Survivors) and survivors that Chuck must encounter in the field (known as Unmarked Survivors). During these
encounters, Chuck must complete a mission for the survivors or do something for them in order to recruit them to his side. Once
a survivor has been recruited, they will follow Chuck wherever he goes. Chuck can also equip his survivors with weapons in order
to protect themselves and food in order to heal. Some survivors, however, are crippled (such as Esther Alwin who is elderly, or Linette
Watkins, who was trapped in a tanning bed and is severely sunburned) and require help walking, usually resulting in Chuck carrying
them piggyback and his attacks being limited to kicking as a result. Survivors and their missions specifically appear at scheduled times
according to the in-game clock and their missions expire at specific times as well. Chuck must encounter the survivor and complete their
mission within the time limit, or else the survivor will be written off as dead and be removed from play. Once recruited, Chuck can take
the survivor anywhere he wants, but ultimately he must take them back to the Safe House in order to fully rescue them.
During the rescue process, it is possible for Chuck to, accidently or not, hit and injure his own survivors and he can even kill
them. If Chuck hits a survivor too much, then the survivor will lose all trust in Chuck and Defect from his party.
Once defected, the survivor, depending on who they are, will either stand in place and refuse to follow Chuck any further (meaning
they will eventually be killed by zombies) or they will follow Chuck around just so they can attack him (which requires Chuck to then
kill them in self defense).
Chuck can have up to 8 survivors with him at a time. Because of the limitations of the game, the game can only spawn 8 survivors in the
entire city at once. Because of this limitation, it is absolutely possible for a scheduled survivor to not spawn at all when it is
time for them to spawn due to there already being 8 survivors in the city. In order to fix this, Chuck must either rescure the survivor
and bring them to the safe house, kill them or let them die, or let their mission expire without encountering them, which removes
them from play. Rescuing survivors successfully rewards Chuck with EXP and, occasionally, a cash prize.

There aren't just survivors located in the city, however. Also located throughout the city are Psychopaths, who are survivors of the
outbreak that have either gone insane or are taking advantage of the chaos for their own insidious reasons. Psychobaths basically
serve as boss fights throughout the game and just like Survivor missions are mostly optional. Some Psychopaths take sane Survivors as hostages in which case, killing the Psychopath is necessary in order
to save hostage's lives. Unlike Survivors, Psychopaths cannot join your party and must be fought to the death.
(The only exceptions to this are Snowflake, a ferocious Tiger who can be either killed or tamed by being fed three pieces of meat,
at which point she will follow Chuck to the Safe House as a survivor,
and Bibi Love, an aging pop star who doesn't attack Chuck and instead demands that he help her perform an impromptu concert in
exchange for her hostages' lives, after which she will join Chuck to the Safe House as a survivor.
Attacking her even once or failing her concert in any way will result in Bibi setting off a series of bombs that her hostages' are 
strapped to, killing them and herself.)
Some Psychopaths are plot-relevant and are required to be fought and defeated in order to progress the plot, or at least, prevent
a bad ending.

Years ago, during another zombie outbreak that Chuck and Katey were caught up in, Chuck's wife was turned into a zombie and had to be
put down by Chuck, but not before she managed to bite their daughter and infect her with the zombie contagion. Ever since then,
Chuck has had to administer daily doses of Zombrex, an anti-zombification drug that prevents a bite victim from turning into a zombie
for 24 Hours, to Katey in order to keep her alive. During his time in Fortune City, this is no different.
Throughout the city, Chuck must search for and collect boxes of Zombrex that can be found in various nooks and crannies. At a certain
in-game time of the day, Katey will be due for another shot of Zombrex. If Chuck fails to find any Zombrex or doesn't return to Katey
in time to administer her dosage, then Katey will die and turn into a Zombie. Despite Katey's death, the game can still be continued
normally, however, the player will be hardlocked into a Bad Ending at the end of the game where zombies infiltrate the Safe House
and Chuck, out of depression over Katey's death, allows himself to be killed.

The most important aspect throughout the game is the Plot Related missions. Just like survivor missions, the Plot Related missions
occur based on a time-table where Chuck must be in a certain spot at a certain time or complete certain objectives before a certain
time in order to progress the story. If Chuck fails these missions or runs out of time without activating the Mission, all
subsequent missions will be declared failed and the player will be given a Game Over. Despite having a Game Over, the player has the
option of continuing the play the game after they have failed, where they can continue to play normally. However, continuing the play
after a Game Over like this will result in the player being hardlocked into a Bad Ending.

## Final Thoughts

I am an avid Dead Rising fan, with the second game being my most favorite. I loved the combat systems and the combo weapon system,
where you can create devastatingly powerful weapons to use against zombies and psychopaths. My most favorite part of the game
is being able to rescue Survivors, as each survivor has different requirements to be recruited, which poses a challenge.
I especially love the open world. Fortune City is an adult playground with various casinos, bars, and attractions that would
please every fun-loving adult and being able to interact with this world, all while killing zombies, makes the experience feel
less like a desperate struggle for survival and more like a morbid vacation.
However, despite my love for the series, Dead Rising 2 is not a completely perfect game, with glitches that happen every now and again,
such as clipping, AIs for survivors being somewhat broken (they will occasionally run off in a random direction when they are
supposed to be following Chuck), and occasionally, being able to see inside character models when the camera is too close.
