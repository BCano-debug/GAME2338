## Summary

In 1803, a tradeship known as the Obra Dinn, carrying 200 lbs of cargo and 60 people on board, set sail from London, England
for the Orient. 
However, the ship never arrived at it's rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.
Years later, in 1807, the Obra Dinn suddenly reappears and drifts back into shore in Falmouth, England with all 60 people on board
missing and unaccounted for.

You play as a nameless insurance agent for the East India Tea Company who was been charged with boarding the Obra Dinn and launching
an investigation to find out what happened. Prior to your trip however, you received a package in the mail from a man named Henry
Evans, one of the people who was onboard the Obra Dinn and who apparently survived. In the package was a mostly blank book and
a mysterious pocket watch called the Memento Mortem pocketwatch. With these tools, Evans wants you to use the pocket watch,
which was the ability to see into the past, and record what happened to the Obra Dinn into the empty book.

The gameplay of the game takes place entirely on the Obra Dinn and revolves around explorlation and investigation.
From the start, the player is given the Obra Dinn Book and the Memento Mortem Pocket Watch. Inside the book is base information
about the ship such as artist sketches of all 60 passengers, a complete passenger list that lists each passenger's name, country
of origin, and role on board the ship, a complete map of the ship, and a glossary of ship terms.

Using the Memento Mortem Pocket Watch, the player, when they come across a body, can use the watch in order to look into the past. The
player is then presented a freeze frame of the individual's death scene as it played out and they are given the opportunity to walk
around the scene and take note of what they see, but on a time limit (the player can go back to the scene at a later point and walk
around as much as they please). Based on the death scenes that the player views in the past, the player must fill the book with
important details about the victim, such as their name and how they died. The player must solve all 60 fates in order to win.

The game makes it clear from the beginning that solving all 60 fates will not be easy and that decisive information is rare. In some
cases, the player must rely on process of elimination in order to find certain information, such as an individual's name.
Throughout the game, the player must be highly perceptive to the details around them as any small detail in the scene could actually
be a hint as to a person's identity, such as the accent of a person's voice (which reveals their ethnicity/which country they came
from), who the person keeps company with (midshipman stick with midshipman, seaman stick with seaman, etc.) and what they are doing
across the ship (could reveal their job).



## Final Thoughts

As a person who loves mysteries and investigation, I enjoyed the game very much. However, I have seen much criticism over the difficulty
level of the game. As stated above, the player is required to be highly perceptive to detail in order to find decisive clues
and not everyone may have the capacity for that. The game requires one to really look and pay attention to everything.
I am impressed though, by the graphics of the game. The entire game is 3D, but it is styled in such as way that it looks like Macintosh
graphics.
