## Details

### Game Title
Osomatsu-san: Hesokuri Wars
Battle of the NEETS!

### Rating

Rating this game from a scale of 1 to 10 I would have to say that this game is a 7/10.

## Summary
This was a mobile tower-defense game based off of an anime called Osomatsu-san.
The original anime followed a group of six sextuplet brothers, the Matsuno Brothers, who are all in their 20s, have differing
personalities, and are all NEETS (Not in Education, Employment, or Training, basically bums) who still live with their parents 
(god bless them) and still aren't searching for jobs or trying to make themselves useful in any way.
Every episode detailed the lives of the Matsuno Brothers as they have crazy adventures throughout the city they live in along with a
colorful cast of characters and friends.

The plot of the game follows the Matsuno Brothers as they travel from city to city all across Japan, looting places for money.
This is where the tower-defense portion comes in. Every level in the game consists of a single battle field with two towers on each side,
yours (the Matsuno residence) and the enemy's. In the game, you must send out troops (consisting of various Osomatsu-san characters), 
who each have their own strengths and weaknesses in order to both defend your tower and attack the enemy's tower. Meanwhile, the enemy 
will be sending out troops of their own for the purpose of attacking you and defending themselves. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm 
the enemy with your forces and take out their tower while keeping your own safe. Winning each round allows you to earn money that
the Matsuno Brothers successfully loot.

Throughout the game, you can obtain more characters to your roster that you can send into battle. As stated above, each character
has their own strenghts and weaknesses. For example, Karamatsu can take more hits than an average character (I usually use him as a
shield), while Jyushimatsu moves faster and can be sent to attack oncoming enemies before they get too far.
If you possess all six brothers, together they can perform a move known as the "NEET Beam" that unleashes a beam of light that
severely damages the enemy tower and can instantly kill all enemies in the way.
With the money you earn from your looting, you can buy power ups that you can add onto your characters to make them stronger.
The game also sports a lottery system, known as a Gatcha Game, where you can spend money in order to try and roll for stronger,
unique characters. The Gatcha Game is basically a gambling system where luck depends on everything. When rolling in the Gatcha Game,
you could get a strong character, or you could get a unique, super strong, rare character, or you could even roll a dud and get a weak
character. If you roll a repeat of a character you already have, the existing character's stats become stronger. The Gatcha Game
will even hold limited time rolls where certain rare characters are only availble for a limited time and will become unavailble after
the time limit passes.


## Final Thoughts

I enjoyed the game immensely, especially because it was about an anime that I enjoy watching.
The difficulty is fair, ramping up in difficulty slowly the further across Japan you travel. 
I guess the only complaint I would have about the game is the Gatcha Game system, where everything depends on luck. You could
sink everything you have into a lottery roll and still not earn anything worthwhile. 
The drops from winning matches are somewhat low as well and it could take many levels before earning enough money to buy anything
decent.
Unfortunately, the game doesn't really hold one's attention for long either as it is the same process over and over again without
adding anything new, but it's still fun enough that one could come back to it out of habit.


## Additional Information

Unfortunately, as of August 30, 2019, the game is no longer in operation in America and is now only availble in Japan.
