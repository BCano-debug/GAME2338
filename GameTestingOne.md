**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules of the game were very clear. The very beginning of the game starts with an easy tutorial that teaches you all of
the controls. Cleverly enough, the tutorial ends up leading into the first plot point of the game.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The game is host to a large variety of enemies consisting of all sorts of evil spirits, each with their own unique appearances
and abilities. However, I noticed that some enemies act exactly the same and the only difference between them is their apperance.
Therefore, I say that there are some enemies that could be removed without affecting gameplay.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ I would say that the game is pretty balanced. As stated above, there are many different kinds of enemies that litter
the streets of the protagonist's neighborhood, all of whom have the ability to kill with one hit. The diagnonal top down view the game
sports allows the player to see enemies up ahead (save for the ones that hide in darkness and have to be revealed via flashlight).
However, the player has limited stamina, there are not many places to hide, and some spirits are simply faster than the player,
leading to an instant death. Getting past these spirits, although not impossible, is definitely tricky.
At the same time, I also noticed that it was, at times, difficult to know where to go, since the game sports an open world along the
streets of the town and you can go anywhere and not know that you're going in the right direction.
I would say that the game is meant for an intermediate gamer. 

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ I would definitely say that the timing is right. The game consists of about six chapters, all of which are long in length.
Either that, or they feel long because some spirits are simply a hassle to deal with and there is a lot of trial and error involved.


**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Absolutely. You play as a girl wandering the streets of her town and night alone, searching for her missing older sister,
all while dodging dangerous spirits that roam the town at night. As the girl, you have the ability to run (but only for a limited time),
pick up items (such as rocks for distractions and coins, in order to make offerings to Jizo statues which serve as save points),
and you own a flashlight that you can use to reveal some spirits who hide in the darkness. The game takes place mostly along the streets
of the girls' town. Being a girl, wandering all alone through her streets at night with dangerous horrors out the kill her; the mechanics
mesh well with the overall horror theme and helps drive home the feeling of being helpless and never knowing about what could be around 
the corner.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I had a lot of fun playing this game, I'd like to know how it ends.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ During gameplay, I did not run into any issues that hindered the game in any way. The game ran pretty smoothly
during the time that I played it.
