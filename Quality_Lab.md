The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

BotW possesses amazing and life-like graphics. When I started it for the first time, I stopped in my tracks and froze as I was in complete
awe over the game world around me. Up until then, I had never seen a game world look so beautiful in all my life. 
The game is also very product based; one can fight, cook, wear different clothes/armor, use magic, and much more. 
The game even possesses a day/night feature as well as a weather feature which adds a major touch of realism. 
BotW is very user-based. There are a lot of controls that can seem overwhelming, but they are easy enough to understand and remember. 
BotW was the game that introduced the Nintendo Switch, having been released at around the same time. 
Because it was one of the first ever Switch games, BotW had to conform to requirements and would've had to meet excellent standards 
in order to make a good impression, not just for the game, but for the Switch as a whole. I believe that the cost is acceptable, 
but only if you're playing without DLC. If you spend money on DLC after you've already beaten the game, then there is really no point 
since the DLC is supposed to enhance the experience.

Grand Theft Auto 5

GTA 5 looks really good and life like. Having seen the game myself, the city in the game looks very life-like, like it could be an actual 
place in our reality. The weather system is very realistic, and the environments looks very accurate when it comes to the city it is based 
off of. The people and animals in the game seem life-like as well. Overall, the entire game looks good. GTA 5 has many of the desired
features that return from previous games; you can walk around and complete missions of an illegal nature as well as cause havoc and 
partake in shootouts and obtain many different kinds of cars and guns. A new feature in this game is the ability to switch between the 
three main playable characters, who each have their own stories that occur over the course of the game.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 
Mario Kart, as with all the Mario Kart games, looks great with diverse backgrounds and a large variety of tracks to choose from. Each 
track is unique and makes the most of it's environment to add challenges to the racers as they race. There are even crossover levels 
that are based off of Animal Crossing and The Legend of Zelda. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has many of the same desired features that return. 
You drive around a track racing other racers and using a variety of wacky items in order to take out the competition. Red shells that 
lock on to targets, bloopers that block opposing player's vision, etc. The game utilizes simple controls that make it easy for any player.
Use the joy-stick to move, hold A to accelerate, use the back left button to drift, press the back right button to use items. 
They are simple controls that even first time players can remember. The game definitely conforms to requirements fitting with the ESRB 
rating. There is a lot of cartoony violence, but nothing so graphic. And, as is the case with Mario Kart, every sequel tends to be better 
than the last and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is no exception, adding on exponentially to an already great formula. And, for $59.99, Mario Kart 8
is definitely worth the money. Given how popular the Mario Kart series is in the Nintendo Game fandom, there is no doubt that Nintendo
made way more money back with this game than the amount it took to make it, so the game was definitely within budget. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
is truly the current paradigm of racing games, that is until Mario Kart 9 comes along.
