### Rating

Insert your own rating.
I rate games out of 10 points.
I would give this game an 8/10.

## Summary
This game follows the nameless protagonist (a boy or girl depending on your choice), who lives in the world of Pokemon.
As with other games in the series, the protagonist is traveling his world, capturing a lot of different Pokemon and fighting through
gyms with the goal of becoming an ultimate Pokemon Master.

To start, the protagonist, in a departure from normal, is given Pikachu as their starter Pokemon rather than having to pick one of three.
This Pikachu follows the player, outside their PokeBall, throughout the entirety of the game. Throughout the game, the player can
pick out clothes for both themselves and the Pikachu, give their Pikachu a nickname, and give them a hairstyle as well as play with
and care for them like a pet. Doing this increases the Pikachu's trust in you and allows it to fight better in battle.

That brings me to the next point, the battle. Throughout the Pokemon World, you will come across other Pokemon Trainers who wish to
battle you as well as random wild Pokemon out in the wildnerness. These Pokemon battles are completely turn based with one player
commanding their Pokemon to attack and then the other responds in kind. The battles, however, are not simply a case of hitting each
other until one faints. Instead, there is a real strategy that takes place in this game. Players must consider type advantages in
their Pokemon (a Fire type will have an advantage over Grass Type, a Water Type over a Fire Type, etc.). When the player wins a battle,
they are awarded with Poke, the in-game currency, and all of the Pokemon in their party gain EXP points that can be used to increase
their levels.
During a battle against wild Pokemon, the player has the option of pulling out a Poke Ball and using it to capture the Pokemon.
If the Pokemon is successfully captured, they will be added to your party.
During the game, the player will also have to go head to head with Gym Leaders who run the Gyms located in various towns throughout
the world. These Gym Leaders are the best of the best and specialize in certain types of Pokemon. Defeating a Gym Leader will reward
the player with a Gym Badge, symbolizing their victory. Collecting all of the Gym Badges will result in the player being
declared a Pokemon Master.

The Pokemon world is a large world with many cities and towns. In each town, there are two common shops: the Pokemon Center and the
Poke Mart. In the Pokemon Center, Nurse Joy, who appears in every location, will heal your Pokemon for free. In the Poke Mart,
the player can use the Poke they've earned in order to buy various items such as potions and heals, as well as sell items they
no longer need.

Ultimately, the player is traveling around, meeting and collecting new Pokemon, and working their way up to being the best Pokemon
Master there is.

## Final Thoughts
I personally really liked the game. As a remake of the original Pokemon Yellow for the Game Boy, I enjoyed being able to experience
the game for the first time. In fact, my father and I used to fight over Pokemon Emerald Green when I was younger.
The environment looks good and is visually pleasing. The characters are likeable and unique. The battle system is not too easy
and not too hard as well, requiring strategy in order to win. As a remake and new (but not latest), entry in the Pokemon series of
games, I feel like this game is definitely a good succession from the previous games.
Even better, because of it's simple controls and it's throwback to the older generation of games, this game is easy enough for
newcomers of the series to enjoy and challenging enough for veterans to love as well.
