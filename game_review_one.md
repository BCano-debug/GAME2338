## Summary
Paper Mario is a game that was released in America in 2001 for the Nintendo 64.
This game takes place in a Mario Universe that, as the title implies, is made out of paper.
All of the inhabitants, buildings, and landscapes are all made of 2D paper.
The fact that everything is paper can even work out to the player's advantage, as they have the ability to unfold,
crumple, and perform actions to certain objects that couldn't be done in real life to help the player proceed.

At the start of the game, we are told the story of the Star Rod which is a mystical rod that has the ability to grant it's user any
wish. As a result, it is heavily guarded in the Star Kingdom by the Seven Star Spirits. Wanting the power of the Star Rod for himself,
Bowser attacks the Star Kingdom and steals the Star Rod, imprisoning the Star Spirits within playing cards and casting them all across
the land. 
Meanwhile, Mario is invited to a party at Princess Peach's castle. While there, Bowser attacks with the Star Rod and lifts the castle
into the sky on top of his own castle, capturing Princess Peach, imprisoning the party guests, and kicking Mario out of the castle to the
land below. Now Mario sets out on an adventure to save the Seven Star Spirits in order to defeat Bowser, reclaim the Star Rod,
and save Princess Peach.

Throughout the game, Mario must travel throughout many exotic lands, each with it's own colorful cast of characters and enemies.
During these travels, Mario can meet and acquire Partners who can help him throughout his adventures using their unique abilities.
And what would be an RPG game without RPG fights? During the game, Mario engages in turn-based fights against enemies with his chosen
Partner by his side (the player can only have one partner out at a time). During these fights, Mario can use items and must rely on 
button prompts and timing in order to make strong attacks against enemies as well as to defend during the enemies' turn. Of course, the 
player must be able to strategize and make proper choices during fights. If an enemy is airborne for example, Mario won't be able to hit
them with a hammer. Conversely, if the enemy has spikes on top of them, then jumping on them will only hurt Mario in return, so he must 
use his hammer instead. Mario is equipped with a Hammer to smash and Shoes for jumping. During the game, one can acquire Badges that 
Mario can wear for certain effects, such as increasing damage for Hammer or Shoes, or increasing HP.

During the game, Mario and his Partners must traverse through various dungeons in order to save the captive Star Spirits.
After rescuing a Star Spirit, Mario is given a special power that he can use from then on to aid him in battle.
Interestingly enough, after a dungeon is cleared and a Star Spirit saved, the game switches POVs and allows you to play as the captive
Princess Peach herself in her captivity in the castle. During these brief sections of the game, Peach finds a way to sneak out of
her bedroom and search about the castle for clues as to the location of the next Star Spirit. The information Peach gathers is then
telegraphed to Mario via Twink, a small Star Spirit from the Star Kingdom who is staying with Peach for her safety.

Optionally, the player may also engage in various sidequests that will give rewards that can help the player throughout their journey.

## Final Thoughts
I really liked the story and the world building that the game introduced. Normally, when one sees say a Goomba or a Koopa in a Mario
game, the first instinct is to treat them as an enemy. However, in the Paper Mario universe, all the Mario races seem to be peaceful
and live in harmony, while also making it clear that the evil enemy Goombas and Koopas and etc. made that choice on their own,
with no relation to their race. Some of your partners in the game even include a Goomba, a Koopa, a Parakoopa, and a Bob-omb just
to name a few. The game also has good humor. One of the running gags in the game is a recurring enemy named Jr. Troopa (who is no more
than a regular bully), who is constantly picking fights with and losing to Mario and co. One joke in the game involved Jr. Troopa
having swum all the way to an island just as Mario and friends were leaving, which meant that Jr. Troopa had to swim all the way back,
which left him extremely exhausted when his battle started. I honestly can't think of anything the game has done poorly.
It was nicely paced, the characters were likeable, and it was difficult without being impossible and every chapter and foray to 
a new area felt like a brand new adventure with it's own storyline, ultimately connecting to the main storyline.
