## Summary
To The Moon is about two doctors, Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts, who work for a company that possesses a machine that allows
one to replay their entire life in their head and to be able to change their memories so they can live an altered life in their head
and fulfill their lifelong wishes that they never got to achieve in real life.
However, because the altered memories conflict with their real memories, the procedure is only legally performed on people who are on
their deathbeds.
One night, Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts are called out to the estate of Mr. Johnny Wyles, a dying old man who is requesting their services
in order to fulfill his wish, which is to go to the Moon. However, Johnny himself does not know why he wants to go to the Moon.
In order to make the process work, Drs. Rosalene and Watts have to comb through his memories using their machine in order to locate
his reason for wanting to go to the Moon. 

So, Rosalene and Watts are taken through Johnny's memories of his entire life starting from his latest memory as an old man and going
backward, all the way to his youth. 

As far as gameplay goes, there is not very much to speak of. The player randomly switches between Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts as playable
characters. As either Rosalene or Watts, the player goes through Johnny's memories and witnesses his life. As such, the game is 
largely text based with characters speaking to each other and the player having to soak up all the details. The gameplay that is
involved in the game involves walking around and exploring the memory. In order to jump between memories Rosalene and Watts have
to find a memento in the memory that is connected to the next memory. However, even after finding said memento, it is normally
blocked with a barrier. In order to access the memento, the barrier must be broken by gathering five "memory links" that are located
around the memory either hidden in an object related to the current memory or in the cutscenes that occur during the memory itself.
When all five memory links are gathered, the player can then destroy the barrier and access the memento. The player must then 
"prepare" the memento in order to jump to the next memory by completeing a simple puzzle game that involves flipping panels on a grid
in a specific order in order to reveal the full picture.

Ultimately, the player is trying to fulfill Johnny's dying wish of going to the Moon.

## Final Thoughts

I absolutely loved pretty much everything about this game. The game is presented in a top down style, with 16-bit graphics, giving
it a sort of old school charm.
There were only a few minor kinks and bugs. Sometimes the movement was klunky
and the puzzle sections didn't add anything and were sometimes tedious and felt like a chore. 
However, where the game ultimately shines is in it's story. The dialogue in the game was cute and had it's funny and sad moments.
The story itself was emotionally gripping and moving with both joyous and heartbreaking moments being shown throughout
the life of Johnny Wyles. By the end of the game, I was completely reduced to tears and sobs.
The music and sounds in the game were also excellently executed and helped provide the tone and very much contributed to the emotional
impact of the game.
Even more impactful was how the game dealt with an issue that is personal to me myself by having a character who is heavily implied
to have a certain condition that I share.
