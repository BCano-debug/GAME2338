# Game Review for Detention

## Details

### Game Title

Detention

### Rating
I rate games out of 10 points.
I would give this game an 8/10.

## Summary
Detention is set in Taiwan during the martial law White Terror period in the 60s.
The game follows a teenage girl named Fang Ray-shin who finds herself suddenly trapped in a nightmarish
version of her school, Greenwoods High School. With monsters and malicious spirits roaming the halls,
Ray must find her way out of the school alive and discover the dark secrets being held by both the school
and within her own past. 

This game is a side scroller in which the main protagonist, Ray, walks left to right or right to left on a single 2D plane.
As Ray, the player can explore their surroundings and collect items that can be used to progress the game.
The nightmarish school is littered with puzzles that the player needs to solve in order to move forward and monsters that they
need to avoid in order to survive. There are also various notes scattered around the area that reveal more of the story and delve
more into Ray's past, slowly telling the story of why she is trapped.
When it comes to the monsters infesting the school, there is no option for combat. Instead, Ray must do various things depending on
the monster she faces. One monster requires her to hold her breath while she walks past them (breathing attracts their attention).
Another monster requires her to remain perfectly still and turn away from it, waiting for it to walk past.

The game also has multiple endings depending on the choices you make throughout the story, having a good and bad ending, along with
an epilogue scene that wraps the entire game up nicely.

## Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed this game. The atmosphere was dark and, mixed with the overall silence, provided a sense of unease.
Even though this was a horror game, the game didn't stoop to using constant over the top jumpscares or anything flat out in your face,
instead opting for more subltle scares, which is where it truly shines. Any scares that were big, were usually far and in between,
leading to an increase in suspense, where you couldn't see where the next scare would be coming from.

I also like the game for being historically accurate. The game goes into detail about the White Terror period in Taiwan when the country
was under extremely strict martial law, in which even the slightest offenses could be extremely harshly punished, and how it affected
the people of the country. This was especially important in telling the story as it proundly affected Ray's past and the decisions
she made in life.
The only criticism I have about the game is that it does sometimes have a tendency to drag. Occasionally, there will be scenes
of just walking and exploring without much to look or interact with, which can make the game feel as though it's grinded to a halt.
However, the story and puzzle solving can easily make up for this, in my opinion.
